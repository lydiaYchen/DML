##  <a name='Coursedescription'></a>Course description

Machine learning systems are often conventionally designed for centralized processing in that they first collect data from distributed sources and then execute algorithms on a single server. Due to the limited scalability of processing large amount of data and the long latency delay, there is a strong demand for a paradigm shift to distributed or decentralized ML systems which execute ML algorithms on multiple and in some cases even geographically dispersed nodes.

The aim of this seminar course is to let students learn how to design and build distributed ML systems via paper reading, presentation, discussion, and project prototyping.&nbsp; We provide a broad overview on the design of the state-of-the-art distributed ML systems, with a strong focus on the scalability, resource efficiency, data requirements, and robustness of the solutions. We will present an array of methodologies and techniques that can efficiently scale ML analysis to a large number of distributed nodes against all operation conditions, e.g., system failures and malicious attacks. The specific course topics are listed below.

The course materials will be based on a mixture of classic and recently published papers. For each topic, &nbsp;the basic concepts and technology landscape will be first provided and then two state-of-the art of papers will be presented and discussed by students.

##  <a name='Learningobjectives'></a>Learning objectives
- Students are able to argue and reason about distributed ML from a systems perspective.
- Students understand the behavior and tradeoffs of distributed ML in terms of performance and scalability
- Students can estimate the importance of data inputs via different techniques, i.e., core set and decomposition methods, for distributed ML systems.
- Students understand data poison attacks and design defense strategy for distributed ML systems.
- Students can analyze the state-of-the art federated machine learning systems and design the failure-resilient communication protocols
- Students are able to design and implement methods and techniques for making distributed ML systems more efficient.

There is no grade but pass/fail of the group project.


**All assessment items ( projects reports) have to be submitted via ILIAS.**




###  7.1. <a name='Groupprojects'></a>Group projects
<!-- 7 predefined project topics: evaluating the systems of 
-->
There are different aspects of performance  on modeling and optimizing the executions of deep neural network jobs. In this project, you will play with benchmarks that emulate the training jobs of deep neural networks on top of Spark platform - one of the most popular platform. You can build a model to predict the performance such jobs, to optimize their response times through resource allocations and scheduling, and to test the dependability of such a cluster against malicious attacks. You will do this project in a group with 1-2 other peers.

- Group size: 2-3 students
- Schedule: initial proposal , interim meeting, report due , and presentation/interview 

At the end of each project phase we will conduct a short interview (20 minutes per group) about the group project and its connection to the course content. Based on the project report and the interview, each member of the group receives a grade. 



In order to pass this course, you need to fullfil **all** of the following:
1. Receive an overall grade of 5.8 or higher (in alignment with TU Delft's exam regulations). 
2. Each homework and project at least a grade of 5.0.
