<!-- 7 predefined project topics: evaluating the systems of 
-->
There are different aspects of performance  on modeling and optimizing the executions of deep neural network jobs. In this project, you will play with benchmarks that emulate the training jobs of deep neural networks on top of Spark platform - one of the most popular platform. You can build a model to predict the performance such jobs, to optimize their response times through resource allocations and scheduling, and to test the dependability of such a cluster against malicious attacks. You will do this project in a group with 1-2 other peers.

- Group size: 2-3 students
- Schedule: initial proposal , interim meeting, report due , and presentation/interview 

At the end of each project phase we will conduct a short interview (20 minutes per group) about the group project and its connection to the course content. Based on the project report and the interview, each member of the group receives a grade. 



In order to pass this course, you need to fullfil **all** of the following:
1. Receive an overall grade of 5.8 or higher (in alignment with TU Delft's exam regulations). 
2. Each homework and project at least a grade of 5.0.
